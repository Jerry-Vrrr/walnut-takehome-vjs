# Jerry Vohrer Walnut Takehome Challenge

## This project is to demonstrate skills in:

- Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS
- CSS transitions and animations
- Clean and DRY JS code
- Fast turnaround time

## Challenges
- I almost mistook the instructions and created a React app instead of a Vanilla JS app. (Glad I asked that clarifying question before coding)
- It had been quite sometime writing a basic JS,  HTML , CSS app, but it was like riding a bike and only took a little poking around to remember everything. 

## Product Walk-through

## Future Additions

- Give users a color pallete to choose different color combinations
- Add sound effects when tiles change color

## Reflections/Wins
